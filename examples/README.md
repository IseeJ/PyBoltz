# Examples directory

This directory contains example scripts that use PyBoltz.

## BatchJob.py
This script is an example of using PyBoltz in a batch job. This code runs PyBoltz and stores the output in a .npy file.

## Example.py
This script is an example of using PyBoltz through the PyBoltzRun wrapper.

## Example.ipynb
This script is an example of using PyBoltz through the PyBoltzRun wrapper in a python notebook.

## Example_Odie.py
This script is an example of using PyBoltz through the OdieRun wrapper/module to generate gas properties on a grid and save the output in a Garfield++ formatted gas file. Additionally it can read the simulation settings from `input.json`. The `ar_90_ch4_10.gas` is an example of a Garfield++ gas file created using `Example_Odie.py`.

## Example_PyBoltz_NoWrapper.py
This script is an example of using PyBoltz without the PyBoltzRun wrapper.

## Example_PyBoltz_mert.py
